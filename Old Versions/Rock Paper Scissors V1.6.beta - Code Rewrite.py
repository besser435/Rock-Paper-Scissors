    RPS Game by Brandon Esser and Carter. V1.6.beta (IFT101 version) Updated October 2021
    It looks bad, we know.

    Changes over 1.5.1:
    WAY more organized. Everything is just in def or class (idk if its the right way)
    Removed HAL anomaly


    V1.7 should:
    add ability to enter a letter instead of the full word      why wont this f*^&%*g work oh god i need a PhD in CS for basic Python this line is way too long oh no oh god
    add proper way of asking for input again if it was invalid the first time (rather than nuking the entire game)
    add sounds and background music with option to enable/disable it
    Investigate Astroid2 glitch



    
    learned enough in this version, some stuff is broken
    im leaving it, look at the full release: V1.6
