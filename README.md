# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Before I moved to GitHub I just had different files for the different versions. Those are in the Old folder.
The GUI folder was an attempt to make a GUI version, but I just don't know enough at this point to pull it off.
The short version is just the most simple form of this game, none of the extra features.


This will probably be the final version. It doesn't really make sense to keep the Arcade version and this stand-alone version updated.
The Arcade is more advanced and has a better framework, so I'll be sticking with that. 
This does have a special place in my cold heart though, as I learned a lot from this project. and it is what really got me into Python.
