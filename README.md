# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Before I moved to GitHub I just had different files for the differnt versions. Those are in the Old folder
The GUI folder was an attemp to make a GUI version, but I just don't know enough at this point to pull it off

TODO LIST:
Move music over to Pygame instead of winsound
Add ability to enter a letter instead of the full word
Add a way of replaying or going to menu when game ends
Make an even more rigged version so the comp will always win. Right now it just leans towards rock

The arcade game version has a few features that should be moved over to this version
